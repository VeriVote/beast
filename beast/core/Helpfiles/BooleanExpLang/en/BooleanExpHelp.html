    The FormalPropertyEditor uses a special language, called BooleanExpLang to allow the formulation of boolean
    Expressions. These boolean Expressions are then what the election description is checked for. This manual
    provides an overview over the different syntactic structures the user can use to build these expressions.
    These structures can generally be divided into two categories: Those which return boolean Values and those
    that return another value. Each given boolean Expression must always return a boolean Value at the highest level.
    It can, however, use the other values to formulate boolean Expressions such as when comparing to integers values.
    The different boolean Expressions are separated by semicolons. To get a first taste of the possibilities, load the
    project LearningBooleanExpLang.beast via the parameter editor. It is a very simple test bed to learn how
    different boolean Expressions work. To see that everything is set up correctly, start an analysis. It should show
    a counterexample after a few seconds.
    If you open the only defined property, you will observe that it has ELECT1 != ELECT2 as a postcondition. If you
    have a look at the election description, you will notice that it always returns 0. This means the first
    candidate always wins regardless of the votes cast. Thus, the postcondition always leads to counterexamples being
    found - if the preconditions can be satisfied.
    To see that this is the case, enter "2 != 2;" as a precondition. If you start an analysis now, you will find
    that it does NOT find a counterexample. This is because it couldn't find a single example which satisfied
    the first expression - 2 != 2 - for obvious reasons.
    To get a taste of the different ways one can set preconditions to change the votes cast, delete this expression.
    Then, write as a precondition: "VOTES1(VOTER_AT_POS(0)) == CAND_AT_POS(2);" and run an analysis. If you check
    out the counterexample, you will find that the first voter in the first round of voting cast his vote for the
    second candidate. You can replace the value passed to CAND_AT_POS with different integers and observe the effect.
    Be aware however, that if you type a number larger than the amount of candidates tested for - 5 - (meaning
    you type in a 4, since counting starts at 0)the result will be undefined behaviour.
    You can also change the number after VOTES from 1 to 2 and observe that the first voter now casts his vote for
    the second candidate in the second round of voting. Translated into natural English, the property would read as:
    The Voter at position 0 (VOTER_AT_POS(0)) votes, in the first round of voting (VOTES!) for the candidate at position
    2 (CAND_AT_POS(2)). Be aware that, while counting for CAND_AT_POS starts at 0, counting for VOTES starts at 1.

    <h2 id="refToTypes">Referring to voters, candidates or seats</h2>
    <p>
        When testing election descriptions for properties, it is often the case that one wants to formulate
        these properties while referring to a specific voter, candidate or seat. Often it is the case that one wants
        to make statements regarding the state of one of these types before the election and its impact on the election result.
        There are two ways one can go about referring to a specific type in BooleanExpLang: Via symbolic variables or by specifying
        a position.
    </p>
    <h3>Symbolic variables</h3>
    Symbolic variables represent any voter, candidate or seat and thus give a possibility to refer to the same type
    in several different places. This enables the user to identify given type instances. Symbolic variables
    are controlled by the area right under the toolbar. To add one, one must simply click on the add-button and
    supply a unique name and a type. Afterwards, it is possible to refer to the created symbolic variable in both
    the pre- and postcondition descriptions.
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li>Test if there is one voter v whose vote always wins the election. Define a symbolic variable v. Define as a
                postcondition: ELECT1 == VOTES1(v);
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Type at Position</h3>
    It is sometimes helpful if one can refer to a type by its position amongst all other instances of the same type.
    For example, one might want to refer to the first voter, candidate, or seat. This can by achieved using the AT_POS
    notation: To refer to a voter at a specific position, simply type VOTER_AT_POS(pos).  Replace pos by the
    desired position, starting at 0. It works analogously for candidates
    and seats: CAND_AT_POS and SEAT_AT_POS. Notice the abbreviation used: CAND instead of CANDIDATE. This saves typing
    and also highlights the word can which is a nice morale boost every time one writes this construct.
    It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that the error checker doesn't check bounds on these passed numbers.
    This means that if the user types VOTER_AT_POS(5), yet tests the property for less than five voters,
    the resulting behaviour is undefined. Instead of a simple integer, any legal expression which
    results in an integer, such as sums involving constants
    can be passed to the AT_POS expression.
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li>Test if the candidate at position 0 always wins: ELECT1 == CAND_AT_POS(0);</li>
            <li>Test if the last candidate always wins: ELECT1 == CAND_AT_POS(C - 1);</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <h2 id="numandsum">Numbers and sums</h2>
    It is often helpful to be able to write and compare sums, products etc. of integer values. BooleanExpLang enables
    addition, subtraction, multiplication and divisions. These can be nested arbitrarily. Their results can be used
    wherever an integer value is expected, such as when referring to a type via its position or when comparing
    values. It is thus possible to write properties such as 2 != 1 + 1. This will obviously always return false. These
    sums and products can contain any expression which evaluates to integers, such as constants or
    VOTE_SUM_FOR_CANDIDATE().
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li>An expression which will always be true: 2 == 2 * 1;</li>
            <li>
                A complicated, probably useless, but nevertheless allowed expression:
                V == C + 3 / S - 4 * VOTE_SUM_FOR_CANDIDATE1(c);
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a sum to refer to a candidate via position: CAND_AT_POS(C / 2) == c;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 id="comparators">Comparators</h2>
    expressions can be compared if and only if their types are the same: candidates with candidates, integers with integers,
    etc. BooleanExpLang supports all common comparison types:
    <ul>
        <li>Equality: ==</li>
        <li>Inequality: !=</li>
        <li>Less than: <</li>
        <li>Less than or equal: <=</li>
        <li>Greater than: ></li>
        <li>Greater than or equal: >=</li>
    </ul>
    When using greater/lesser comparisons with voters, candidates or seats what's compared is their placement. So,
    VOTER_AT_POS(0) < VOTER_AT_POS(1) would be true, whereas CAND_AT_POS(5) >= CAND_AT_POS(6) wouldn't be.
    <h2 id="quantifiers">Quantifiers</h2>
    May times, one wants to define a property which should hold for all or at least one Voter,Candidate or Seat.
    This can be accomplished using quantifiers.
    <h3>For all</h3>
    In order to define that a property should hold for all instances of a type, one can use the FOR_ALL constructs.
    These exist for the three most important types: voters, candidates and seats:
    <ul>
        <li>FOR_ALL_VOTERS() :</li>
        <li>FOR_ALL_CANDIDATES() :</li>
        <li>FOR_ALL_SEATS() :</li>
    </ul>
    All three expect an as of yet undefined symbolic variable as an argument passed between the brackets.
    In the boolean Expression following the colon, this symbolic variable can be used to describe a
    property which needs to hold for all variables of the same type.
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li>All voters vote for candidate at position 0: FOR_ALL_VOTERS(v) : VOTES1(v) == CAND_AT_POS(0);</li>
            <li>ALL candidates have at least one vote: FOR_ALL_CANDIDATES(c) : VOTE_SUM_FOR_CANDIDATE1(c) > 0;</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>There exists</h3>
    If one wants to define a property which holds for at least one voter, candidate or seat one can use
    the THERE_EXISTS constructs. Their are, analogously to the FOR_ALL expressions, one for each type:
    <ul>
        <li>EXISTS_ONE_VOTER() :</li>
        <li>EXISTS_ONE_CANDIDATE() :</li>
        <li>EXISTS_ONE_SEAT() :</li>
    </ul>
    They each expect an as of yet undefined symbolic variable to be passed between the brackets. This variable
    can then be used in the boolean expression following the colon to define a property which must hold for
    at least one voter/candidate/seat.
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li>There exists a least one voter who votes for the first
                candidate: EXISTS_ONE_VOTER(v) : VOTES1(v) == CAND_AT_POS(0);
            </li>
            <li>
                For each seat there exists one candidate occupying this seat:
                FOR_ALL_SEATS(s) : EXISTS_ONE_CANDIDATE(c) : ELECT1(s) == c;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 id="binary_rels">Binary boolean relationships</h2>
    Binary boolean relationships are very common when formulating boolean expressions. BooleanExpLang provides the most
    common and useful ones:
    <ul>
        <li>Logical And: &&</li>
        <li>Logical Or: ||</li>
        <li>Implication: ==></li>
        <li>Equivalence: <==></li>
    </ul>
    Using these, two boolean Expressions can be combined to produce a third one.
    <div class="example">
        <ul>
            <li>
                A candidate wins if and only if he has more than half the votes:
                ELECT1 == c <==> VOTE_SUM_FOR_CANDIDATE1(c) > V/2;
            </li>
            <li>
                If a candidate has more than 2 and less then 5 votes, the first voter votes for him:
                (VOTE_SUM_FOR_CANDIDATE1(c) > 2 && VOTE_SUM_FOR_CANDIDATE1(c) < 5) ==> VOTES1(VOTER_AT_POS(0)) == c;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
